# ---------- Data Cleaning ----------

# Data cleaning means fixing bad data in your data set

# Bad data could be:
    # Empty cells
    # Data in wrong format
    # Wrong data
    # Duplicates

# In this tutorial you will learn how to deal with them

# ---------- Our Data Set ----------

# In the next chapters we will use this data set:

# "originalData.csv", I recommend making a copy of it to work with and compare

# The data set contains some empty cells ("Date" in row 22, and "Calories" in row 18 and 28)

# The data set contains wrong format ("Date" in row 26)

# The data set contains wrong data ("Duration" in row 7)

# The data set contains duplicates (row 11 and 12)
